## Overview

This GitHub Organization serves as the official collaboration hub for our Senior Capstone research project within the Cyber Operations Engineering Emphasis BAS program at the University of Arizona.

Our team was selected to participate in the **Arizona Cybersecurity Clinic**, where we are conducting applied research on AI agentic systems within the IoT security landscape.

This organization contains project planning materials, architecture documentation, research artifacts, and links to implementation repositories developed throughout the capstone lifecycle.

## Program Affiliation

**Arizona Cybersecurity Clinic**  
https://azcast.arizona.edu/arizona-cybersecurity-clinic  

The Arizona Cybersecurity Clinic provides hands-on research and engineering experience focused on real-world cybersecurity challenges, emerging technologies, and operational defense strategies.

## Research Focus

Our capstone research centers on the design and evaluation of modular AI agent systems that support cybersecurity workflows in IoT and small-to-medium enterprise environments.

High-level areas of focus include:

- AI-assisted log and network traffic analysis  
- Human-in-the-loop security operations workflows  
- Retrieval-augmented learning systems  
- Explainable AI for defensible cybersecurity reasoning  
- Purple-team aligned investigative guidance  
- IoT-focused telemetry and analysis environments  

The system emphasizes analyst augmentation, workflow transparency, and standards alignment rather than fully autonomous threat detection.

Detailed architecture and technical implementation are maintained within the project-specific repository.
